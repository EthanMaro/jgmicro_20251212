    <li><strong>Input Data:</strong> The app processes numerical input solely on your device to perform the requested unit conversions (e.g., cm to ft, or ft to cm). This input data is not stored or transmitted externally.</li>

  <p>The app may display advertisements via Google AdMob or other third-party ad networks. These ad networks may collect non-personal device identifiers and usage data to serve personalized or non-personalized ads, as governed by their respective privacy policies.</p>
